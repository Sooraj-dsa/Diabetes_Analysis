# Diabetes Analysis Dataset

This repository hosts a dataset and analysis focused on diabetes. The data and analysis provide valuable insights for understanding diabetes risk factors and diagnostic indicators.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises essential health measurements and attributes that are crucial for predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. These include the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI (Body Mass Index), and age.

### Key Insights:

- **Pregnancies:**
  - The number of pregnancies does not influence the diagnosis of diabetes.

- **Glucose:**
  - A normal post-glucose blood sugar level is below **140 mg/dL**.

- **BloodPressure:**
  - Normal blood pressure at rest is below **120 mmHg**.

- **SkinThickness:**
  - Normal skinfold thickness on the triceps is less than **25 mm**.

- **Insulin:**
  - Normal insulin levels after a 2-hour period are below **30 ÂµU/mL**.

- **BMI:**
  - BMI in the range of **18.5 to 30** is considered normal.
  - BMI over **30** indicates obesity, a significant factor contributing to diabetes.

- **Diabetes Risk Factors:**
  - Higher levels of Glucose, BMI, and DiabetesPedigreeFunction significantly increase the likelihood of having diabetes.

## Additional Information on Diabetes

Diabetes is a chronic health condition characterized by elevated levels of blood sugar (glucose) in the body. It is a significant health concern affecting millions of individuals worldwide. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood and requires regular insulin injections for management. Type 2 diabetes is more common and often related to lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity, and obesity.

Regular monitoring of glucose levels and other health measurements is crucial for managing diabetes effectively. Understanding the key indicators and risk factors, as provided in this dataset, can aid in early detection and better management of this condition.
